#  COVID Dataset Cleaning in SQL
This project focuses on cleaning a COVID dataset using SQL Server to prepare it for analysis. The cleaning process involved managing null values, standardizing data formats, and removing inconsistencies. Various SQL techniques, including Basic Aggregations, Joins, and Window Functions, were applied to ensure the dataset was structured and ready for insights. The project demonstrates a strong grasp of SQL data cleansing methodologies to handle real-world pandemic-related data efficiently.
